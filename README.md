# My mission statement:

I'm Ingrid. Web Software Developer. I've been building projects from scratch, mainly with JavaScript skills, React & Node.Js. I started coding six months ago thanks to CoreCode io Software Development Fundamentals program as a Backend enthusiast. Currently, I'm coursing the Full-Stack bootcamp program. I want to be a developer because I'm changing career paths and I learned the valuable lesson of not being afraid of change. I'm a curious and commited person in every project I involve.
